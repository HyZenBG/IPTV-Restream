# IPTV StreamHub

> [!NOTE]  
>A simple IPTV `restream` and `synchronization` (watch2gether) application with `web` frontend. Share your iptv playlist and watch it together with your friends.
> 
>Actively in devlopment and open for your ideas! <br>
> [TEST HERE](https://ante.is-a.dev) (Only for testing, the used channels are free and not reliable)

## üí°Use Cases
- [x] Connect with **multiple Devices** to 1 IPTV Stream, if your provider limits current streaming devices.
- [x] Proxy all Requests through **one IP**.
  - [x] Helps with CORS issues.
- [x] **Synchronize** IPTV streaming with multiple devices: Synchronized playback and channel selection for perfect Watch2Gether.
- [x] **Share your iptv access** without revealing your actual stream-url (privacy-mode) and watch together with your friends.

## ‚ú® Features 
**Restream / Proxy** - Proxy your iptv streams through the backend. <br>
**Synchronization** - The selection and playback of the stream is perfectly synchronized for all viewers. <br>
**Channels** - Add multiple iptv streams and playlists, you can switch between. <br>
**Live chat** - chat with other viewers with a randomized profile.

## üöÄ Run

### Run with Docker (Preferred)

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antebrl/IPTV-Restream.git
```

Make sure to have docker up & running. Start with docker compose
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Open http://localhost

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If a channel/playlist won't work, please try with `restream through backend` option enabled. This fixes most of the problems! It leads to longer initial loading times. If you don't need synchronization, turn it off in the ‚öôÔ∏è or set the delay in the [config](docker-compose.yml).

## üÜì Free compatible playlists

These are some tested playlists as an example. Use your own iptv playlist for the best quality!
- [Free TV Channels](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv): Huge collection of free tv-channels. One playlist for every country.

---

- [Streamed SU Sports playlist](https://github.com/dtankdempse/streamed-su-sports): Sport live-events
- [Daddylive playlist](https://github.com/dtankdempse/daddylive-m3u): Various tv-channels including sport

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure to set the required headers for the playlist (Origin, Referer, User-Agent)! <br>
> You don't need the m3u-playlist-proxy! Just use proxy or restream mode.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

### Channel Mode
#### `Direct`
Directly uses the source stream. Won't work with most of the streams, because of CORS, IP/Device restrictions. Is also incompatible with custom headers and privacy mode.

#### `Proxy` (Preffered)
The stream requests are proxied through the backend. Allows to set custom headers and bypass CORS. This mode is preffered. Only switch to restream mode, if proxy mode won't work for your stream or if you have synchronization issues.

#### `Restream`
The backend service caches the source stream (with ffmpeg) and restreams it. Can help with hard device restrictions of your provider or synchroization problems (when your iptv channels have no programDateTime). But it can lead to longer initial loading times and performance issues after time.

## FAQ & Common Mistakes

Which streaming mode should I choose for the channel?

> Generally: You should try with direct mode first, switch to proxy mode if it doesn't work and switch to restream mode if this also doesn't work.
>
> Proxy mode is most likely the mode, you will use! You will need restream mode especially when your iptv playlist has no programDateTime set and you want to have playback synchronization.

My playlist only supports xtream codes api!

> [IPTV playlist browser](https://github.com/PhunkyBob/iptv_playlist_browser) allows you to export a m3u playlist from your xtream codes account, and let's you select single channels or the whole playlist. Official xstreams-code integration is planned!

Error: `Bind for 0.0.0.0:80 failed: port is already allocated`

> To fix this, change the [port mapping in the docker-compose](docker-compose.yml#L40) to `X:80` e.g. `8080:80`. Make also sure that port X is open in the firewall configuration if you want to expose the application.
---
Is it possible to run components seperately, if I only need the frontend OR backend?

> If you only need the **restream** functionality and want to use another iptv player (e.g. VLC), you may only run the [backend](/backend/README.md).
> <br>
> If you only need the **synchronization** functionality, you may only run the [frontend](/frontend/README.md).
>
> Be aware, that this'll require additional configuration/adaption and won't be officially supported. It is recommended to [run the whole project as once](#run-with-docker-preferred).
